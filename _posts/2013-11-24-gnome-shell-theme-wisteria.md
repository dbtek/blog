I upgraded my system to Gnome 3.10 and loved it, besides having lots of crashes which i am getting used to. These new styles on Gnome 3.10 was fascinating. After quick digging I found some flat icons and an awesome chameleon tool for shell ([elegance-colors](http://satya164.deviantart.com/art/Gnome-Shell-Elegance-Colors-305966388)).

I made a theme with elegance-colors to fit magnificent moka pair (gtk+ theme and icons) and named it *Wisteria*.

Wisteria is a flat, stylish theme for Gnome Shell. It's name comes from [Flat UI Colors](http://flatuicolors.com). Wisteria is the name of the color basically used in the theme.
