Theme I am using on this blog, named ***dbyll*** is available on github under MIT license.

I am very pleased with this theme, always wanted to develop a theme for my blog. This couldn't be any easier, thanks to Jekyll. I made two adaptation of the theme. One for usual jekyll sites, and one for [jekyll-bootstrap-3](http://dbtek.github.io/jekyll-bootstrap-3). I particularly use the second one here.
