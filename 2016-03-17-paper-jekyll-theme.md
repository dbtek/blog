Besides frontend engineering, I kinda like designing interfaces. Sometimes I need to design small tools and apps to refresh myself.

This is one of these "small" tools to refresh myself. I have experiences with Jekyll for a long time now thanks to my personal blog and [Dbyll](http://ismaildemirbilek.com/jekyll-theme-dbyll), another theme that I have open sourced quite some time ago.

Jekyll is not only a good suit for blogs, but also powers other types of web sites as well.  I hope I will be writing about that soon.

Here you can find some screenshots of the theme. As always feel free to use, modify and <
